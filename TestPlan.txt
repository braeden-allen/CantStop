TEST PLAN - MODULE 1 (DICE)

To meet the expectations for this module, we aim to extensively test all possible outcomes of our code.
1. We must make sure that the dice will produce pseudo random values in the range of 1..6 upon each roll
    To do this, we will use the unitDice() function from the UnitTest class to output into a .txt file and
    ensure that all values that are produced fall within the range of 1..6
2. We must make sure that the destructor will work for the Die values
    To do ensure successful run of the destructor, we will make sure that 0 errors are produced upon calling
    and instance of the class, which will prove success
